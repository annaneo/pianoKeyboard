# pianoKeyboard
A flexible virtual piano keyboard based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
You can embed the piano in your website with only a few lines of JavaScript. The piano will create music as [Plaine & Easie Code](https://www.iaml.info/plaine-easie-code) and can render it to a SVG displaying the played notes using the great [Verovio Toolkit](https://www.verovio.org/download.xhtml).

# Usage
## Requirements
The keyboard and the Verovio Toolkit work on any recent browser (for Internet Explorer version 10 is required).

## Installation
For the piano display you  ned the `piano.js` and `piano_style.css` files and jQuery.
If you want to display the played notes in musical notation, you also need to reference the [Verovio Toolkit](https://www.verovio.org/download.xhtml).

Embed it like this:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="piano_style.css">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit.js"></script> <!--Only needed for notes display-->
<script src="piano.js"></script>
```

The Piano makes only basic use of jQuery, so any version of jQuery should work fine.

## Basic Use
The Piano can be displayed inside any container with enough size.

Add an empty `div for the piano and one for the notes display:

```HTML
<div id="keyboardContainer"></div><!-- this will hold the keyboard -->
<div id="svgNotesContainer"></div><!-- this will hold the SVG with rendered notes -->
```

You can now have the keyboard rendered inside that div:

```JavaScript
<script type="text/javascript">

    $( document ).ready(function() {
        //create piano with 3 octaves, starting at C4 (lowest key)
        //shows labels and octave shift buttons
        var keyboardHTML = htmlForKeyboardWithOctaves(3, octaves.C4, true, true)
        //render the keyboard in the div
        $("#keyboardContainer").html(keyboardHTML)
        //when keys are pressed updatePreview() is called
        bindKeysToFunction(updatePreview)
        //when the clef is changed updatePreviewWithClef() is called
        bindClefSelectionToFunction(updatePreviewWithClef)
        //set the default clef to G4
        setSelectedClef(clefs.G4)
    })

    //this stores all keyboard input
    var plaineEasieCodes = []
    var selectedClef = clefs.G4

    //this is called whenever a piano key is pressed
    function updatePreviewWithNote(sender, paeNote) {
        console.log("key pressed is " + paeNote)
        plaineEasieCodes.push(paeNote)
        updateNotesSVG()
    }

    //this is called when the user changes the clef for display
    function updatePreviewWithClef(sender, clef) {
        console.log("clef changed to " + clef)
        selectedClef = clef
        updateNotesSVG()
    }

    function updateNotesSVG() {
        //render the notes to an SVG using the Verovio tookit
        //width of the svg is 800px and note scaling 50%
        var notesSVG = svgNotesForPlaineEasieCode(plaineEasieCodes.join(""), selectedClef, 800, 50)
        //insert thes SVG code in our div
        var svgContainerDiv = $('#svgNotesContainer')
        svgContainerDiv.html(notesSVG)
    }

</script>
```

This creates a piano keyboard in the `keyboardContainer` and adds a callback function `updatePreviewWithNote()` that is called whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard.

The `updatePreviewWithNote()` function takes the last played note in Plaine & Easie Code and appends it to the `plaineEasieCodes` array. In the `updateNotesSVG()` the codes in that array are joined to a single string and sent to the `svgNotesForPlaineEasieCode()` function.

The `svgNotesForPlaineEasieCode` function takes a Plaine & Easie code and returns the notes rendered in SVG format using the Verovio Toolkit. We then put this in our `notesSVG` div.


## Configuration

### Keyboard functionality
To create a piano keyboard you use the function

```JavaScript
function htmlForKeyboardWithOctaves(numberOfOctaves, startOctave, showLabels, withShiftButtons, withNoteSelection, withClefSelection)
```
With the following options:

* `numberOfOctaves`: Number. How many octaves are displayed
* `startOctave`: the lowest displayed octovate. Use the `octaves` object to select an octave like `octaves.C4`
* `showLabels`: Bool - default true. Sets whether the first keys of each octave have labels indicating their pitch
* `withShiftButtons`: Bool - default true. Sets whether on the left and right side of the keyboard arrows buttons are displayed for the user to shift octaves up or down
* `withNoteSelection`: Bool - default true. Sets whether buttons are displayed to select the note length (like half, quarter, eigth, etc.)
* `withClefSelection`: Bool - default true. Sets whether a button is displayed to switch between bass and violin clef (this is only relevant for display and does not affect the Plaine & Easie Code)

To actually react on pressed keys you need to register a callback function that is called when a key is pressed. For example:
```JavaScript
//when keys are pressed updatePreview() is called
bindKeysToFunction(updatePreview)
```
The callback function should have a signature like
```
function updatePreview(sender, paeNote) {
    console.log(paeNote)
}
```
The `sender` is the dom object that was clicked by the user. The `paeNote` is the Plaine & Easie Code of the pressed key.


You also need to register a callback function for when the user changes the clef (if you have clef selection activated). For example:
```JavaScript
//when the clef is changed updatePreviewWithClef() is called
bindClefSelectionToFunction(updatePreviewWithClef)
```
The callback function should have a signature like
```
function updatePreviewWithClef(sender, clef) {
    console.log(clef)
}
```
The `sender` is the dom object that was clicked by the user. The `clef` is the new selected clef.

Usually both callback functions are used to re-render the displayed notes but could also be used to play sounds, for insance. (Midi sounds can be generated with the Verovio Toolkit)

### Notes rendering
The `piano.js` offers a convenience function to render the Plaine & Easie Code to a SVG with musical notation. That function `svgNotesForPlaineEasieCode()` encapsulates the Verovio Toolkit. You can of course use the [Verovio Toolkit directly](https://www.verovio.org/javascript.xhtml), which gives you more control about display.

To conveniently render notes in SVG use the following function:

```JavaScript
function svgNotesForPlaineEasieCode(paeCode, clef, width, scalePercent)
```
With the following options:

* `paeCode`: String. The Plaine & Easie Code to render
* `clef`: String. The clef to use. Recommended to use the `clefs` object to select a like `clefs.G4`
* `width`: Number - Sets the width of the created SVG canvas
* `scalePercent`: Number - The scale (= size) of the rendered notes. This is a percent value. For most cases between 20 and 80

### Layout and Styling
The most part of the styling happens in the `piano_style.css`. You can overwrite the style or change them directly to change the appearance of the keyboard.


## Known Issues
### Keyboard size
Currently the keyboard / key size is set fixed in the `piano_style.css`.

If you have an idea how to make the keyboard scale depending on its container size, please create a pull request.
